# chrisdeleon.github.io

This is a project that I worked on for my dad's business. This was my first serious project. Every line of code was built from scratch. Since my dad had no internet presence, I attempted to establish that with the little knowledge I had at the time. Although the website is very simple, it accomplishes establishing an online presence with accurate information.
